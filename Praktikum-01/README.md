## **Project's Name:**
# Praktikum-01

## **Description**
Just a Java exercise demo project for **OODBS** class at **Bakrie University**.

This project contains two simple Calculators:
- A simple standard calculator inspired by Windows 10's Standard Calculator, I use Formdev's **FlatLaf** library for to imitate the flat and dark Look-and-Feel of the Windows 10's calculater. 
- Also a quite simple logical calculator for 'NOT', 'AND', and 'OR' operation.

I use Microsoft VS Code for editor.

## **Here comes the auto-generated texts on _Getting Started_ with Java on VS Code**

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

### Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

-- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
-- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

### Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
